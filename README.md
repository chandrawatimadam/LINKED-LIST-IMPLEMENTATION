##A LINKED LIST IS A DYNAMIC DATA STRUCTURE WHERE ELEMENTS CALLED NODES, ARE LINKED TOGETHER USING POINTERS.EACH NODE CONTAINS TWO PARTS: THE DATA AND A POINTER TO THE NEXT NODE IN THE SEQUENCE.

UNLIKE ARRAYS, LINKED LISTS DO NOT STORE ELEMENTS IN CONTIGUOUS MEMORY LOCATIONS.THIS STRUCTURE ALLOWS FOR EFFICIENT INSERTION AND DELETIONS OF ELEMENTS,AS ONLY THE POINTERS NEED TO BE AJUSTED,

RATHER THAN SHIFTING ELEMENTS AS IN AN ARRAY.LINKED CONTAIN NODES WHICH HAVE DATA AND POINTER.DATA HOLD THE ACTUAL VALUE OR INFORMATION THAT THE NODE REPRESENTS.POINTER NEXT IS A MEMORY THAT POINTS

TO THE NEXT NODE IN THE LIST.THE LAST NODES POINTER TYPICALLY POINTS TO NULL,INDICATING THE END OF THE LIST.LINKED LIST ALSO USE MEMORY ALLOCATION,ALLOWING THE LIST TO GROW OR SHRINK DURING RUNTIME.

THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF LINKED LIST FISRT ONE IS SINGLY LINKED LIST WHERE EACH NODE POINTS ONLY TO THE NEXT NODE.SECOND ONE IS DOUBLY LINKED LIST WHERE EACH NODE HAS TWO POINTERS ONE TO THE NEXT NODE AND ONE

TO THE PREVIOUS NODE.AND THIRD ONE IS CIRCULAR LINKED LIST WHERE THE LAST NODE POINTS BACK TO THE FIRST NODE FORMING A LOOP.LINKED LIST PERFORMED OPERATIONS LIKE INSERTION,DELETION,TRAVERSAL,SEARCHING ETC.
